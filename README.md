# Portfolio_Revamped

Yet another portfolio revamp.

This time we're going to be using a lot of the same tech in my previous iteration. My primary goal is to create something similar, just with routing. I've gained a lot of knowledge in the realm of web development since my last creation, so this time it's going to be focused more on writing clean and reusable code. One of the primary hitting points will be my routing as well, I want to use actual routes for everything, as well as viable links to deployed content. Pills will be added to projects without viable deployment, and they will be categorized by date / project type as well.

I want this to be my own little corner of the internet. I want it to encapsulate everything I do, not just my code life.

Let's make something beautiful.
