# Portfolio_Revamped

Yet another portfolio revamp.

This time we're going to be using a lot of the same tech in my previous iteration. My primary goal is to create something similar, just with routing. I've gained a lot of knowledge in the realm of web development since my last creation, so this time it's going to be focused more on writing clean and reusable code. One of the primary hitting points will be my routing as well, I want to use actual routes for everything, as well as viable links to deployed content. Pills will be added to projects without viable deployment, and they will be categorized by date / project type as well.

I want this to be my own little corner of the internet. I want it to encapsulate everything I do, not just my code life.

Let's make something beautiful.

## Notes

A lot of my notes are going to be written as comments, but I'll put some generalized ones here.

- Dark / Light Theme:

I've always been a huge fan of the dark/light theme vibe, so I'm itching to jump on that at some point or another. I'll probably attach it as a small fun thing to work with at some point.

- ThreeJS Animations (loading):

A ThreeJS loading animation between the screens would be cool. I've got a good idea of what I would use, I'll link it in here later on when I find it. Just something to show state management between routes.

- B-Roll Background (Landing):

This is a bit off-the-wall, but I'd like to have a broll background for the landing page. I'll have to get some footage for it, but I think it would be cool to have something a bit more personal, and it would add some life to the page.
